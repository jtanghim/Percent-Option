# Percent-Option
In short this program analyzes the total percentages of 2 sides and provides the user with feedback on how to either match/exceed the other total percentage.
Inspired by the game Clash of Clans, this program is designed to help the user decide which base to use their last attack on in a very close war. Wars are won
by stars and percentage damage with the former taking precedence. The one with the more stars wins. If both sides have the same number of stars then percentage damage is the 
deciding factor, hence this is where my program comes in. Stars are easier to count as it ranges from 0 to 3; however, percentages can get a little tricky
and require more time to analyze as it ranges from 0 to 100. My program prompts the user to input size of war, number of bases not completely destroied, and the percent damage
those bases have. It analyses each of these bases and informs the user if it is possible to tie/win the war if the selected base is attacked. 
It also provides the user with the necessary percentage needed to either tie/win.
